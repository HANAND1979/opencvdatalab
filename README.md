# opencvdatalab
OpenCV and Datalab in themselves are very powerful. This is an attempt to create a unified Dockerfile which you can use to build an image which has Datalab has base and OpenCV baked on top of it. 

The OpenCV installation code is based on code published at https://github.com/milq/milq/blob/master/scripts/bash/install-opencv.sh and has been adapted to Dockerfile format.
